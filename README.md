# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Horiseon Refactor

# Description
The wesbite needed to be more accessible especially for people with disabilities. So to impress future clients, I made the website more accessible which in return made the search engine optimization rank higher in search engines like Google. The accessibility was enhanced by consolidating the selectors in CSS, and organizing the HTML elements in a semantic structure which includes comments before each element or section of the page.

There were a ton of issues with both the HTML and CSS files. For HTML, I changed the title so it could better reflect the website and I updated most of the elements so they all weren't "Divs". I changed the elements so they could follow a semantic structure which includes a head, body, headers, main, sections, functioning links and a footer. I made sure that it was linked to the CSS Style sheet and that the selectors were reflected accuratley in the CSS file. I also organized the CSS file by grouping the selectors in order by priority. That order is Universal, HTML, Class and ID selectors. I also consolidated some of the areas which were duplicates so it could be more efficient when updating the styles. In all, the code has a lot more structure and it is easier to follow and change items for the future.
